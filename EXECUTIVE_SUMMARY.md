# üìä Executive Summary - BTC Crowdfund Analytics

> **Note:** This document captures the earlier BTCPay-centric MVP scope.  
> The repository has since pivoted to an Angor-only analytics dashboard ‚Äî see `README.md` for the current status and roadmap.

**Project:** Bitcoin Crowdfunding Analytics Dashboard  
**Status:** ‚úÖ MVP Complete (Demo Mode) | ‚ùå Real Integration Pending  
**Last Updated:** October 11, 2025

---

## üéØ What We Have

### ‚úÖ Fully Functional MVP
- **FastAPI web application** serving on localhost:8000
- **Interactive dashboard** with KPI cards and Chart.js visualizations
- **SQLite database** with 30 seeded demo invoices
- **17 passing unit tests** covering core functionality
- **Complete UI** with dashboard, settings, and webhook logs pages
- **Professional code quality** with type hints, error handling, and documentation

### üé® User Experience
Users can currently:
- View aggregated Bitcoin crowdfunding analytics
- See time-series charts of daily fundraising
- Monitor invoice status distribution
- Check webhook delivery logs
- Toggle between BTCPay and Angor data sources

---

## ‚ùå What We DON'T Have

### Critical Integration Gaps

1. **BTCPay Server** - Template only, never tested
   - Code exists but never called a real BTCPay API
   - Don't know if our data format assumptions are correct
   - Webhook verification untested with real signatures

2. **Angor Protocol** - Placeholder only
   - Can't find official API documentation
   - No Nostr integration whatsoever
   - Only demo JSON data works

3. **Production Infrastructure**
   - No deployment (local only)
   - No SSL/HTTPS (required for webhooks)
   - No monitoring or error tracking
   - No authentication or security

---

## üî¥ Critical Unknowns

### BTCPay Server
- ‚ùì Does the real API response format match our expectations?
- ‚ùì Will webhook signature verification work with actual BTCPay signatures?
- ‚ùì How do we handle pagination for large stores?
- ‚ùì What are the actual rate limits?

### Angor Protocol
- ‚ùì Where is the official API documentation?
- ‚ùì What are the actual API endpoints for hub.angor.io?
- ‚ùì Which Nostr NIPs does Angor use?
- ‚ùì How do we get real-time funding updates?
- ‚ùì Should we poll the hub, subscribe to Nostr, or both?

### Architecture
- ‚ùì Should we cache with Redis or wait for performance issues?
- ‚ùì When to switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL?
- ‚ùì Should data fetching be synchronous or async with background jobs?
- ‚ùì How to store BTC amounts without precision loss?

## üìà Integration Roadmap

### Phase 1: BTCPay Server (Immediate - 2-3 days)
**Goal:** Connect to real BTCPay instance and verify everything works

**Tasks:**
1. Set up account on testnet.demo.btcpayserver.org
2. Generate API key with proper permissions
3. Update .env with real credentials
4. Test `get_invoices()` endpoint with real API
5. Set up ngrok tunnel for webhook testing
6. Create test invoice and verify webhook delivery
7. Fix any bugs discovered

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Can fetch real invoices from BTCPay
- ‚úÖ Dashboard displays real data (not demo)
- ‚úÖ Webhook delivery works and signature verifies
- ‚úÖ No errors in logs

---

### Phase 2: Angor Protocol (Next - 4-5 days)
**Goal:** Understand and integrate real Angor data

**Tasks:**
1. Research Angor Hub API (reverse engineer if needed)
2. Document actual API endpoints and response format
3. Understand Nostr integration requirements
4. Add python-nostr dependency
5. Implement Nostr client for project events
6. Test with real Angor projects

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Can fetch real Angor projects from Hub
- ‚úÖ Understand Nostr event structure
- ‚úÖ Display real project funding data
- ‚úÖ Get real-time updates

---

### Phase 3: Production Hardening (1-2 weeks)
**Goal:** Make production-ready for real users

**Tasks:**
1. Fix BTC precision (use satoshis not floats)
2. Add database indexes for performance
3. Add Redis caching layer
4. Implement proper logging (structlog/loguru)
5. Add error tracking (Sentry)
6. Add authentication (OAuth2 or JWT)
7. Switch to PostgreSQL
8. Deploy to cloud (Railway, Render, or DigitalOcean)
9. Add SSL certificate for HTTPS
10. Set up monitoring and alerts

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Deployed to public URL
- ‚úÖ HTTPS enabled
- ‚úÖ Can handle 10,000+ invoices
- ‚úÖ Monitoring dashboard shows metrics
- ‚úÖ Zero critical errors in 7 days

---

## üéì What We Learned

### What Works Well
‚úÖ **FastAPI** - Great for rapid MVP development  
‚úÖ **SQLModel** - Clean ORM with Pydantic integration  
‚úÖ **Chart.js** - Easy to implement, looks professional  
‚úÖ **Demo Mode** - Excellent for development and testing  
‚úÖ **Modular Architecture** - Easy to understand and extend

### Technical Debt Identified
üü° **Float precision** - BTC amounts lose precision (should use satoshis)  
üü° **No indexes** - Will be slow with large datasets  
üü° **No caching** - Recomputes everything on every page load  
üü° **Print statements** - Should use proper logging framework  
üü° **No pagination** - API calls will timeout with large stores

### What We'd Do Differently
üí° **Use integers for BTC** from the start  
üí° **Add Redis early** for caching  
üí° **Test with real API sooner** instead of assuming format  
üí° **Research Angor more** before starting integration  
üí° **Use PostgreSQL** even for development

## ü§î Questions for Expert Review

When sharing with ChatGPT or other developers, ask about:

1. **BTCPay Integration**
   - Is our API wrapper pattern correct?
   - Are we handling errors properly?
   - What's the best pagination strategy?
   - How to test webhooks reliably?

2. **Angor Protocol**
   - Where to find official API docs?
   - Best architecture for Nostr integration?
   - How to verify decentralized funding amounts?
   - Should we poll or subscribe to events?

3. **Architecture**
   - When to add Redis caching?
   - How to structure background jobs?
   - Best practices for Bitcoin precision?
   - Security considerations for webhook endpoints?

4. **Production**
   - Recommended hosting platform?
   - How to monitor Bitcoin applications?
   - Best practices for API key storage?
   - How to handle Bitcoin network delays?

## üìÅ Key Files to Review

For code review or AI analysis, focus on:

1. **`app/btcpay_client.py`** (110 lines)
   - BTCPay API wrapper - never tested with real API
   - Check if our API assumptions are correct

2. **`app/webhook.py`** (150 lines)
   - HMAC verification logic
   - Critical for security - needs real testing

3. **`app/angor_adapter.py`** (100 lines)
   - Angor integration stub
   - Needs complete rewrite once API is understood

4. **`app/analytics.py`** (160 lines)
   - Aggregation functions
   - Check if efficient with 10K+ invoices

5. **`app/models.py`** (50 lines)
   - Database schema
   - Review: float vs integer for BTC amounts
